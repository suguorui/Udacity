#THREE GOLD STARS

#Sudoku [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku]
#is a logic puzzle where a game
#is defined by a partially filled
#9 x 9 square of digits where each square
#contains one of the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
#For this question we will generalize
#and simplify the game.


#Define a procedure, check_sudoku,
#that takes as input a square list
#of lists representing an n x n
#sudoku puzzle solution and returns
#True if the input is a valid
#sudoku square and returns False
#otherwise.

#A valid sudoku square satisfies these
#two properties:

#   1. Each column of the square contains
#       each of the numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

#   2. Each row of the square contains each
#       of the numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

correct = [[1,2,3],
           [2,3,1],
           [3,1,2]]

incorrect = [[1,2,3,4],
             [2,3,1,3],
             [3,1,2,3],
             [4,4,4,4]]


def check_sudoku(p):
    n = len(p)   #size of the grid
    digit = 1 #start examining elements
    while digit <= n: #go through each digit
        i=0
        while i<n: # go through each row
            rowcount = 0
            colcount = 0
            j=0
            while j<n: #go through each column
                if p[i][j] == digit:
                    rowcount = rowcount + 1
                if p[j][i] == digit:
                    colcount = colcount + 1
                j = j+1
            if rowcount !=1 or colcount!=1:
                return False
            i = i+1  #next row/column
        digit = digit + 1  #next digit
    return True #nothing is wrong!
